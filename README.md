# Showcase

Hello! I am Pierre. I graduated from UPEI with Computer Science degree in 2015. I mainly coding in C++ and Java, but also can code in Objective-C, C#, html, javascript, SQL, XML, and more. Moreover, I enrolled in VGPS (Video Game Programming Specialization) when I studied in UPEI, so I am better in graphics-related stuff such as shaders, vectors, matrix, lighting, camera, models, behaviors, animation, gaming physics, objective-oriented design, and so on. I am also minor in mathematics.

In this repository, you can find out my resume, and a github page list down below that shows my works. Every repository has its description in readme file telling that codes in the repository were made in what year with what environment. Some of them are too big for github so I only upload them partially, which means, it won't work correctly.

Here are the page list:
